# EXPLANATION:
- The ".main" class styles the main container with flexbox properties, making its child elements arrange in a column layout. It also sets the font-family to a series 
  of fallback fonts, specifying that if one font is not available, the browser should try the next one in the list. It adds a bottom border with a dark color.
- The ".data" class styles the individual sections with a width of 30% of the container's width, so they take up 30% of the available space.
- The "h3" selector styles the heading level 2 'h2' with a color of "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)" (a slightly transparent black).
- The "p" selector styles all paragraphs with a color of "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)" (a somewhat transparent black).
